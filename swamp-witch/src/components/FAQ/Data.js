    question: 'How do I take care of my new tattoo?',
    answer: "Cleanliness is key! Use an anti bacterial soap I.e. dr. Bronners and a paper towel to clean your new tattoo once the bandage is removed. Then pat dry with a piece of paper towel. I don’t recommend using a regular towel/cloth as bacteria can live on it! Then you can apply a thin layer of whatever aftercare you decide to use, my recommendation is a simple unscented lotion but there are many types of different aftercare available and we also sell some at the shop!"
