  WIP, refresher on google maps API, set up new project to get API key. https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-add-a-custom-google-map-with-react-faf009e4d2b5
12:00pm -12:30 
  failed to use maps with that tutorial. switching npm dependencies

1:30-2:00pm

2:00pm - 2:45pm
  work on styling for location component, realize google maps doesn't auto scale TT^TT

2:50-3:00pm
  much needed break
3:00pm-4:30pm: 
  start building gallery component

////////////////////////////////////////
12/7

8:00am - 8:30am
  add hover effects for gallery images, update image styling
8:30-9:10am
  start on writing handler functions for gallery and lightbox components
9:10am - 9:45am
  switch gears and add state/ conditional rendering
9:45am - 10:00am
  get placeholder images for flash/pet portraits (screen-grabs from IG, waiting on actual gallery pics)
10:00am-10:15am 
  create object arrays from flash/ pet portraits
10:15-11am
  adding smooth scroll. Realized react-scroll doesn't work on component state change
11:00am-12pm
  try different ways to get scroll to work... decided it wasn't worth the time and moved the gallery into the main page. It's not quite what the client wanted, but it'll have to do. Updated state to change the album viewable in the gallery on click. 

  plan for after lunch:
  - sticky navbar
  - contact page
  - revisit lightbox component?? (not necessary, but would be nice)
  - make shop open new tab

12:00-12:30pm 
  lunch break!

12:30pm - 3:00pm
  completely redoing navbar. making sticky to top, adding logo placeholder, attempting to path with react-router-dom
  (the page was looking a bit too much like a basic react dev portfolio with only smooth scroll)
  UPDATE! Got the new navbar working with react-router-dom and react-router-hash-link. The latter allows for hash navigation after route render and contains a scroll (for use with custom functions) :D
3:00pm - 4:50pm
  working on small media scaling. add new css for small media view ports, add expanding side navigation bar for small media
  WIP:struggling with expanding navbar for small media
4:45pm 
  realized hash scroll isn't working properly again TT^TT works when a component is rendered on click, but not when the component is already rendered onClick
4:45-5:05pm
  fixed hash scroll for real this time! looking into animated route changes

sat 12/18

  add logo to navbar. Had trouble centering without cutting off the top of the image

2:30-2:50
  add sidebar dropdown
  -- refactor later? weird skip thing happening
2:50-3:05pm 
  add click functionality to close sidebar
