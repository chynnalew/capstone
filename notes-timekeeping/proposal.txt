Name of Student:
	Chynna Lew

Name of Project:
	Tattoo Site (for Victoria Varty @ Anatomy Tattoo)

Project's Purpose or Goal: 
	This site will act as a portfolio/ communication app for a local tattoo artist. She wants a dynamic site that stands apart from traditional tattoo websites.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
	Media scaling for dynamic viewing on multiple screen sizes
	Connection to Instagram (and Tik Tok?). She’s okay with links, but would prefer to have an Instagram slideshow.
	Feature to allow clients to fill out a form that sends her an email
	Finding an affordable web host for the artist to deploy her new site

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
	I am planning on using React for the front end (this may change depending on our Friday consultation). If not React, I’ll use vanilla JS with Html and SCSS.
	She really wants the site to be dynamic, so I expect the project to heavily rely on SCSS.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
	Building out a scheduling application that allows clients to request consultation/ appointment dates/times and upload reference photos.
	-Allowing the artist to approve or deny scheduling requests

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
	If she decides she wants a scheduling application built into the site (stretch goal), I’ll also use C# and MySql as the backend.
	I’m not 100% positive on the authentication I’d like to use, but I’m leaning towards Userfront Framework.
